This game is a super traditional twin stick shooter bullet hell game.  This is my first game jam and the most playable game I've made so far (by far) thanks to having a deadline/goal to meet.

Player movement is using WASD keys and shots track to the mouse cursor.  Shots are automatic since who ever lets go of the shoot button in a twin stick shooter?
